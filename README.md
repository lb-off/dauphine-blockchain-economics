# Dauphine-Blockchain class

This repo contains smart contracts for the blockchain economics class at Paris-Dauphine University.

It contains the Solidity code of 2 tokens (the DauCoin and the PhineCoin), as well as a simplified version of an AMM similar to UniSwap v2 with a Constant Product pricing function.

In the AMM repository, there is also a file `LToken.sol` which is used by the AMM at deploy time to create a liquidity token that can be used by Liquidity Providers to redeem their liquidity.

The repo contains a file `addresses.txt` with the addresses of deployed contracts on both the Goerli and Sepolia testnets.
